## 4. Color Scheme/Gradients
Choosing the colors was pretty hard so to ease up the process I searched up "nicest colors for HTML web designing" on google. I selected colors that are soft, modern, and visually appealing. Gradients were used in the header and the footer. The colors I chose for the gradients were mediumslateblue to lightblue and lightsteelblue to mediumslateblue, to have a aesthetic color transition.

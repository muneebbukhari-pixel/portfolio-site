                <h2>CCNA: Introduction to Networking</h2>
                <p>
                    I completed the Introduction to Networking Certification.
                    From this course I learned the fundamentals of networking, 
                    IP addressing, subnetting, and configuring routers and switches 
                    using Cisco Packet Tracer.

                <h2>Mini Munchies</h2>
                <p> 
                    I started a small business called Mini Munchies, where I sell
                    mini pancakes. This project helped me learn about entrepreneurship,
                    customer service, and basic management skills while working on something 
                    I enjoy.

                <h2>Memorization of the Quran</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my most meaningul achievements has been memorizing the Quran.
                    This required strong focus, discipline and time consistency. The biggest 
                    part of this journey was how it helped me build patience and mental strength.

                <h2>Networking Lab Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Using Packet Tracer, I built and configured a network topology with multiple PCs, 
                    routers, and switches. This project gave me hands-on experience in troubleshooting and 
                    configuring networks.

                <h2>Python Programming Project</h2>
                <p>
                    During first year, in my programming class, I created a simple python application that 
                    performed calculations and data processing. This project helped me improve my coding logic
                    and problem-solving skills.
